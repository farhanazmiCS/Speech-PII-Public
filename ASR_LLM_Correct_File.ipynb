    "# Rethinking PII identification from Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the efficacy of various prompt-engineering techniques for PII identification. Previously, we employed an entity-aware ASR model—fine-tuned on Singlish speech and enhanced with an expanded tokenizer—to perform NER tagging directly on speech. In that setup, the LLM correction module was tasked with addressing both transcription errors and PII-tagging errors, potentially limiting its ability to focus solely on improving PII detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we will use the fine-tuned ASR model (trained on Singlish dialects) with its default tokenizer and delegate the entire PII tagging task to an LLM. This approach allows us to systematically compare different LLM prompting methods to determine which yields the best performance for our PII identification objectives."

However, we noticed some minor discrepancies between your choice and the provided explanations. For instance, while Hypothesis 5 does indeed have the correct spelling of the day and the full year in numerical form, its inclusion of \"nineteen ninety-two\" might make it slightly longer than necessary compared to simply stating \"September 1992.\" Nonetheless, given the available choices, Hypothesis 5 aligns closely with the preferred format outlined in the task instructions.
